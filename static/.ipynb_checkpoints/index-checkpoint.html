              Replace all labels and inputs with the relevant features for your
              model
              Attributes to note:
              id: this is used on the front end to link the label to the input
              name: this is used on the back end when you submit the form; it
                becomes the key in the params dictionary
              value: this is the default value of the input. not necessary but
                helpful for speeding up demos

              The <br>s between each label/input combo are a quick and easy way
              to put each one on its own line. They aren't necessary for the
              form to function but they help the flow without needing a lot of
              nested <div>s to achieve the desired layout

          This application is designed to detect whether an email is spam or not in order to save yourself and others from falling prey to dangerous emails
        </p>
        <p>
          When using this application please just paste the body of the email into the text box. This will in turn be ran through our code and formatted correctly to run through our model. Once ran through the model we will effectively be able to determine whether or not the email that you have received is spam!
